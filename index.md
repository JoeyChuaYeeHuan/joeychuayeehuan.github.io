<!-- Teaching Vision Section -->
<section id="teaching-vision" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
  <h2>üéì Teaching Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Teaching has been a meaningful part of my journey for over a decade.
    As a freelance tutor with 10 years of experience, I have provided one-on-one tuition to primary and secondary school students across a range of subjects, focusing on building strong foundational skills and fostering independent learning. 
    This long-standing commitment to education has not only strengthened my pedagogical skills but also deepened my passion for helping learners grow.
  </p>
  <p>
    I derive a deep sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from seeing students improve over time‚Äîwhether it is mastering a complex concept or gaining the confidence to tackle academic challenges.
    I believe that effective teaching extends beyond content delivery; it involves cultivating a supportive learning environment, promoting critical thinking, and adapting instruction to meet diverse learning needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I advance in the field of analytics and technology, I hope to bring this same passion for mentorship and clarity into more formal teaching or training roles‚Äîespecially in areas where data and digital literacy are key to future readiness.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to equip students with practical, industry-relevant skills‚Äîparticularly in analytics, automation, and digital tools‚Äîwhile nurturing curiosity, resilience, and a growth mindset. 
    I am especially committed to helping students connect theoretical knowledge with real-world applications to prepare them for the evolving demands of the digital economy.

    I am an aspiring analytics professional with a strong foundation in banking and business operations.
    I hold a Bachelor's degree in Finance and have held diverse roles across the financial sector‚Äîincluding compliance, teller services, account opening, HR operations, and merchant payment systems at UOB, Citibank, and OCBC.
  </p>
  <p>
    These experiences taught me the value of process efficiency, stakeholder engagement, and data integrity. 
    My exposure to financial operations, MIS reporting, and automation (e.g., SAP GL, Robotic Process Automation tools) inspired me to pursue my Master in Analytics and Visualization (MAVI) at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, where I am currently achieving First Class Honours. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I now specialize in applied analytics using R, Python, SQL, and automation platforms like UiPath, ServiceNow, and Workato‚Äîand have applied them across multiple high-distinction academic and capstone projects. 
    My passion lies in bridging domain knowledge with digital solutions that drive operational improvement and strategic value.
  </p>
  <p>
    I bring to the table a unique blend of industry experience, technical proficiency, and a passion for mentoring students through project-based learning.
    I enjoy helping students gain confidence with digital tools while developing their critical thinking and communication skills‚Äîreflected in my decade-long tutoring journey.
    This GitHub portfolio showcases projects that reflect my learning, work ethic, and vision as a future-ready educator. 
    I look forward to contributing to NYP‚Äôs School of Business Management by delivering quality learning, supporting innovation, and shaping digital-ready professionals.
