<p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">
Final Grade: <strong>A</strong> | ANL503 – Data Wrangling & Reporting (SUSS)
</p>

<p>
This project was developed as part of the <strong>ANL503 Data Wrangling and Reporting</strong> module at SUSS. It showcases an end-to-end data preparation and reporting solution using <strong>Python, MySQL, R, and ggplot2</strong>. 
I analyzed shopper demographics and behavior across 6 major malls, producing visual dashboards to help the client understand audience profiles and footfall trends.

<h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
<p>
To clean, validate, and analyze survey data collected from multiple shopping malls and create an integrated report visualizing key customer segments — enabling targeted marketing and mall management strategies.
</p>

<h2>🔧 Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python – Data ingestion and pre-cleaning (pandas, openpyxl)</li>
  <li>MySQL – Database design, schema creation, data type tuning, anomaly correction</li>
  <li>R (ggplot2, patchwork, gridExtra) – Multi-plot dashboard and statistical visualizations</li>
</ul>
