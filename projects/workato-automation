<h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
<p>
To improve customer satisfaction by automating fault detection and alert notifications using an iPaaS (Workato).
The solution consolidates siloed CRM data, interprets network faults, and sends real-time alerts to impacted customers.
</p>

<h2>🔧 Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Workato (iPaaS) – Recipe-based low-code automation</li>
  <li>Google Sheets – Simulated data lake and CRM source</li>
  <li>JSON file – Simulated Juniper network service data</li>
  <li>Telegram – Simulated SMS notification for broadband issues</li>
  <li>Email – Notification channel for mobile network issues</li>
  <li>Mistral (GenAI) – Automated message generation</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧪 Solution Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>
The solution integrates five modular Workato recipes to process incoming network fault data, cross-reference impacted customers,
and notify them in real-time through appropriate channels. CRM data from Salesforce and Amdocs is combined into a unified customer view.

<h3>📁 Workato Recipe Breakdown</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Recipe 1:</strong> Parses a JSON file with network status data and stores it in Sheet 4 (Service Status)</li>
  <li><strong>Recipe 2:</strong> Identifies impacted customers based on failed locations and logs them in Sheet 6</li>
  <li><strong>Recipe 3:</strong> Sends email (for mobile faults) or Telegram (for broadband faults) alerts using Mistral-generated content</li>
  <li><strong>Recipe 4 & 5:</strong> Combine Salesforce and Amdocs CRM records into a consolidated customer data lake (Sheet 5)</li>
