  <h2>🎓 Teaching Vision</h2>
  <p>
    My teaching vision is to nurture digitally fluent, analytically driven learners who are confident navigating both business and technology. 
    I believe polytechnic education must bridge the gap between theory and industry practice — equipping students with skills that are immediately applicable and adaptable to change.
  </p>
  <p>
    I strive to create a learning environment where students build business intuition through data and automation tools like Excel, SQL, UiPath, and Workato. 
    Beyond technical proficiency, I guide learners to apply structured thinking and real-world context — from managing digital workflows to visualizing customer trends.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also advocate for the digitalization of academic processes, having integrated tools like Google Sheets, Tableau, and UiPath in my personal applied projects to reduce manual effort and improve data accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to mentor students into future-ready professionals who don’t just follow business processes — but improve them.
